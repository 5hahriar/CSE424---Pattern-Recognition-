Title: Comparative study on interpretable E-commerce Price Prediction.
[Not submitted in any conference]
Abstruct-In recent years, e-commerce has exploded in popularity due to the speed and convenience of exchanging goods and global services. It makes an attempt to explain the principle behind e-commerce, business models designed specifically for e-commerce, and the merits of each as well as its inherent restrictions and limits. It comes to the conclusion that engaging in e-commerce affords a number of benefits to the various stakeholders. Researchers have conducted several experiments to make E-commerce sites more feasible and accessible to the customers using machine learning and deep learning. Similarly, we have also experimented and implemented several supervised learning algorithms to make price predictions. We also have made an comparative study on machine learning and deep learning models using XAI. Among the models, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier both gave the best accuracy score with 95.05% and Random Forest Classifier gave the best root of mean squared error with 7.64.
